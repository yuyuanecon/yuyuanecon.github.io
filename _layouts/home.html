        I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at HKU Business School, The University of Hong Kong, with research interests in international macroeconomics and finance. My current research explores themes such as the Global Financial Cycle, the international transmission of monetary policy, and the dynamics of interest rates and exchange rates.
